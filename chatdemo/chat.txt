Solution: Keep the Container Running
Modify the CMD in your Dockerfile to keep it running:

Updated Dockerfile

# Use minimal Alpine base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Install basic utilities (optional)
RUN apk add --no-cache bash coreutils

# Set working directory (optional)
WORKDIR /mnt/shared

# Keep container running
CMD ["sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 30; done"]
Rebuild and Run the Container
Step 1: Build the Image

docker build -t alpine-container .
Step 2: Run the Container

docker run -d --name alpine-test -v ~/docker_shared:/mnt/shared alpine-container
-d runs it in detached mode so it stays alive.
Step 3: Access the Running Container

docker exec -it alpine-test sh
Now you should be inside the container without errors. ðŸŽ‰

Alternative: Run in Interactive Mode
If you don't want to modify the Dockerfile, just start the container in interactive mode instead of detached mode:

docker run -it --name alpine-test -v ~/docker_shared:/mnt/shared alpine-container sh
This keeps the container alive until you exit manually.

Would this work for you? ðŸš€
